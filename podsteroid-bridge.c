/*
 * podsteroid-bridge — virtio-console socket ↔ PTY relay for PodSteroid
 *
 * Bidirectional relay between:
 *   stdin/stdout  — PTY slave (Termux TerminalSession)
 *   terminal.sock — QEMU virtio-console chardev (/dev/hvc0 in VM; primary terminal)
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   - PTY → VM: keystrokes pass through raw; the VM's getty/bash handles echo/editing.
 *   - VM  → PTY: output forwarded as-is. virtio-console reports real terminal
 *     size via TIOCGWINSZ inside the guest, so we don't need to intercept
 *     ESC[18t queries (the old PL011-serial hack).
 *   - SIGWINCH: TerminalSession calls ioctl(TIOCSWINSZ) on PTY master →
 *     we write "RESIZE rows cols\n" to ctrl.sock (/dev/hvc1 in VM) → init
 *     daemon stty's hvc0 → foreground TUI gets SIGWINCH.
 *
 * Signals:
 *   SIGPIPE  — ignored; EPIPE on write = EOF, handled in main loop
 *   SIGINT   — graceful shutdown
 *   SIGTERM  — graceful shutdown
 *   SIGWINCH — async flag, debounced in the select() loop. Each signal just
 *              refreshes a timestamp; send_resize() fires once after the
 *              burst has been quiet for RESIZE_DEBOUNCE_MS.
 *
 * Args: <terminal.sock> <ctrl.sock>
