/**
 * The interesting case is a phone on mobile data that is also tethering: the default
 * route is the carrier's, so that is the "primary" address, yet the address a tethered
 * PC must dial is the private one. Both need to be visible, and the useful ones first.
 *
 * Addresses here are illustrative only. 100.x is carrier-grade NAT space, which the
 * ranking treats as non-private; the 192.168 and 10.x values stand in for a LAN.
