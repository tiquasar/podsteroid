/**
 * Pins which port forwards are allowed onto QEMU's launch command line.
 *
 * This is a safety boundary, not a style choice. SLIRP aborts the whole launch
 * when any single hostfwd cannot be set up, and the rules are persisted, so
 * every rule inlined here is a rule that can permanently stop the VM from
 * starting. That is not hypothetical: a user who added 1005 forwards, most of
 * them inside Android's ephemeral port range where something is always already
 * bound, was left with a VM that could never boot again and concluded it had
 * destroyed their data.
 *
 * User rules therefore go in over QMP once the VM is up, where a rule that
 * cannot bind is one failed rule instead of a dead VM.
