/**
 * Unit tests for AvfDownloadsShare.connectWithRetry — the pure retry helper
 * behind AvfEngine's vsock connect to the guest's 9p rendezvous listener.
 * These tests never touch a real vsock socket or ParcelFileDescriptor; they
 * drive the generic retry policy (now suspend, so it is cancellable in
 * production) with a plain marker object and a no-op suspend sleeper via
 * runBlocking, so the exhausted-budget case does not really sleep.
