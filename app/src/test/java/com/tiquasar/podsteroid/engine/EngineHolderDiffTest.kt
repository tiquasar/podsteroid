/**
 * Pins the pure port-forward diff used by EngineHolder's reconciliation loop.
 *
 * The load-bearing property is the cold-start seeding: when the VM enters
 * Running, appliedRules is seeded from the launch set (the rules already baked
 * into QEMU's cmdline). An unchanged boot must therefore produce no work
 * (added == removed == empty), and a rule removed during the boot window must
 * still be torn down on Running.
