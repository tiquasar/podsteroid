 * Pure logic for the AVF multi-vCPU boot policy. AVF's public Builder API only
 * exposes ONE_CPU (1 vCPU) or MATCH_HOST (all host cores) - see
 * AvfReflect.setNumCpus. MATCH_HOST clones the host's heterogeneous big.LITTLE
 * topology into the guest device tree, which makes the guest reset in early
 * boot on some SoCs (Tensor G3/G4: STOP_REASON_REBOOT, no panic - issue #29).
 * 1 vCPU always boots because none of that topology is emitted.
 *
 * Two tiers request multi-core (see AvfEngine.buildConfig):
 *  - Android 16+: an exact homogeneous vCPU count via the raw AIDL
 *    (AvfReflect.installExplicitCpuCount) - no heterogeneous topology at all.
 *  - Otherwise: MATCH_HOST bounded by `nr_cpus=N` on the kernel cmdline
 *    (all vCPUs still exist; the kernel onlines only N).
 *
 * This object decides the effective core count and the descending fallback
 * ladder shared by both tiers, adaptively and without any per-device model
 * hardcoding: a normal launch tries the user's requested count; an early-boot
 * reset steps the count down and the result is persisted per device so later
 * launches go straight to the value that boots.
 *
 * Pure (no Android deps) so it unit-tests on the JVM.
