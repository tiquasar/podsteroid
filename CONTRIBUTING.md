# Contributing to PodSteroid

Thanks for considering a contribution. Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are all welcome.

Before you start, please skim [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). It documents the VM-engine abstraction and both backends, the boot pipeline, every native binary, and the design quirks you need to know to make changes that don't regress.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone .git
cd PodSteroid
```

You will need:

- **Docker 20.10+** for the kernel, initramfs, rootfs, and QEMU build pipelines
- **Android NDK r27c** for the bridge and Termux native libraries
- **Android SDK** with platform 36 + build-tools
- An **arm64 Android device** running **Android 8.0+ (API 26)** for testing

## Build pipeline

`build-all.sh` orchestrates every component:

```sh
./build-all.sh kernel       # custom Linux kernel (~5-10 min, Docker-cached)
./build-all.sh initramfs    # kernel + minimal initramfs
./build-all.sh rootfs       # Alpine squashfs (~30 s, Docker-cached)
./build-all.sh qemu         # QEMU + podsteroid-bridge (~30 min first run)
./build-all.sh termux       # terminal-emulator JNI via local NDK
./build-all.sh apk          # Android APK via Gradle
./build-all.sh all          # everything
./build-all.sh deploy       # all + install + launch
./build-all.sh test         # deploys APK, polls console.log for "Ready!"
```

Component versions are pinned in one place each, so read the pin rather than trusting a number written in prose:

| Component | Pinned in |
|---|---|
| Linux kernel | `podsteroidKernelVersion` in `gradle.properties` |
| QEMU | `podsteroidQemuVersion` in `gradle.properties` |
| Alpine | `ARG ALPINE_RELEASE` in `build-rootfs/Dockerfile.rootfs` |

Or, for the common case where you only changed Kotlin / UI code:

```sh
./gradlew installDebug
```

## Reporting bugs

Please open an issue using the **Bug Report** template. The most useful single thing you can attach is the diagnostic log:

`Settings → Diagnostics → Export Log`

It bundles app version, device model + Android version, settings, and full logcat in one file. If the bug is VM-side, also include the VM console:

```sh
adb shell run-as com.tiquasar.podsteroid.debug cat files/console.log
```

Note that `run-as` works on debug builds only. Release builds are not `run-as`-able, so use the in-app export there.

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch (`fix/issue-42`, `feature/whatever`).
2. Keep pull requests focused: one fix or one feature per PR.
3. Work through the checklist below before opening the PR.
4. Match the existing code style of the file you are editing.

### Before you open a PR

**Run the unit tests.** Use the `:app:` form; the bare task name does not behave the same way.

```sh
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

**Test on a real arm64 device.** Emulators do not exercise the QEMU and native-binary path the way real hardware does. Unit tests cover pure logic only, so anything touching VM behaviour, the engine boundary, or a user-visible flow is unproven until it runs on hardware.

If your change touches the engine boundary or AVF, note that the two backends need two different devices: only a device reporting `android.software.virtualization_framework` can exercise AVF at all.

```sh
adb shell pm list features | grep virtualization
```

See [Proving a change on a device](CLAUDE.md#proving-a-change-on-a-device) for the grant sequence and which backend needs which device. **Say in the PR which backends you actually tested on.** Backend asymmetry is the most common source of bugs here, so a QEMU-only test is the easiest way to ship a regression.

**Add both translations for any user-facing string.** Every string needs an entry in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and `app/src/main/res/values-zh/strings.xml`, and must be referenced with `stringResource`. Do not hardcode user-facing text.

**Never rename a DataStore key without a migration.** Saved user state has to survive every release, since updates install in place. The Kotlin identifier is free to change, but the string literal is an on-disk contract: renaming it orphans the stored value and the setting silently reverts to its default on the user's next launch. `DataStoreKeyContractTest` will fail if you change one. If the rename is deliberate, ship a migration that reads the old key and writes the new one, and update the expectation in the same commit.

**Update the docs your change affects.** If it is user-facing, update [`README.md`](README.md). If it changes the architecture, boot pipeline, terminal layer, or kernel options, update [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) too.

### Commit messages

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): summary`, all lowercase.

```
fix(avf): distinguish an absent GPU API from a failed declaration
docs(site): explain how to reach the desktop from another computer
test(data): pin the persisted DataStore key literals
```

The body should explain **why** the change is needed, not restate what the diff does. A reader six months from now needs the reasoning, not a summary they could get from `git show`.

Avoid `fixes #N` or `closes #N` unless you intend the issue to close when the commit lands, since those keywords close issues automatically. Use `for #N` or `addresses #N` to reference without closing.

## Code style

- Kotlin: follow the [official conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
- Keep it simple. No premature abstractions.
- Match the surrounding file's style. Consistency beats personal preference.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Self-documenting names go further than prose.
- No emoji, and no em dashes, in code, comments, commit messages, or documentation. Use hyphens, commas, colons, or restructure the sentence.
